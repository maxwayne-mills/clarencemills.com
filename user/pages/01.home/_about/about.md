## About Me

I consider myself a technologist as I have always enjoyed computers from an early age and enjoy using and learning about all sort of technologies new and emrging. I am also an avid user and promoter of Open Source software, which has been part of my life since I started college. One main reason I used open source software was that it allowed me the opportunity to learn new things on a very low budget. I started out in softare and moved to hardware but I find myself coming back to so
ftware as cloud infrastructure becomes a dominant force.

Always render more and better service than is expected of you, no matter what your task may be

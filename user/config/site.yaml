# HOW TO CREATE A VALID ID TO USE:
# Go to www.twitter.com and sign in as normal, go to your settings page.
# Go to "Widgets" on the left hand side.
# Create a new widget for what you need eg "user time line" or "search" etc.
# Feel free to check "exclude replies" if you don't want replies in results.
# Now go back to settings page, and then go back to widgets page and
# you should see the widget you just created. Click edit.
# Look at the URL in your web browser, you will see a long number like this:
# 657554810648948736 
# Use this as your ID below instead!
